MUCH MUCH more to come here but it'll happen....

It's finally done so I'll have to get pictures up. I can now monitor the door state of my wine fridge turned humidor, therefore Wineador, as well as control the humidity with the cheap humidifier modules from Amazon. Stay tuned for the write-up and pics!
